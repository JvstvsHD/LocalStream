# LocalStream
LocalStream is a streaming service written in Java and Kotlin. You can play music from a server (later you can also watch video, but this features is not implemented yet).
You need to set up a server yourself (or use a server of another person). Currently, there is only a client for desktop PCs. A app for Android (and maybe iOS) is planned.

## Important notes
- **This project is still in development and there are no releases yet. However, you can compile the client yourself.**
- The GUI is only available in **German**. There will be support for other languages (at least English).
- Current existing Java code will be replaced with Kotlin.
